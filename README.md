# Ecoleta

Project Ecoleta an application for waste collection.

Ecoleta is the **Next Level Week #1** :rocket: project, creating a project with backend, frontend and mobile using **TypeScript**, **React** and **React Native** stack.

## Backend :scroll:

To build backend it was used [express router](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/guide/routing.html) to management routes of application. To validate requests, it was used [Joi validation](https://github.com/arb/celebrate) of celebrate. To persist and get data it was used [knexjs](http://knexjs.org/) with **SQLite**.

I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) to test requests. You can find my insomnia.json [here](/backend/insomnia.json).

For further information about technologies used, click above the links :wink:

### Features

- Register point of waste collect :heavy_check_mark:

### Running

First enter on backend project

`cd backend`

After, run:

`npm install`

On first time running the application we need run a npx command to apply migrations

```console
npm run knex:migrate
npm run knex:seed
```

Then we can startup the application

`npm start`

The application will be run on http://localhost:3333.

## Frontend :computer:

To build frontend it was used [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to http requests and to management routers it was used react-router-dom

### Features

- Create point of waste collect :heavy_check_mark:
- Upload image :heavy_check_mark:

### Running

First for frontend works, We'll need backend running on `http://localhost:3333` because axios will try to call this path.

Whit this done run

`npm install`

After that

`npm start`

## Mobile :iphone:

As in frontend, mobile application builded using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

### Features

- Search list of waste collection :heavy_check_mark:
- Filtering by type of waste collection and picking in map :heavy_check_mark:
- Detail of waste collection :heavy_check_mark:
- Whatsapp message :heavy_check_mark:
- E-mail message :heavy_check_mark:

### Running

As in frontend, here We'll need a backend running, but you'll need config your backend IP on file [api.ts](/mobile/src/services/api.ts).
This case my backend it was running on **_http://192.168.0.4:3333_** , you may to replace baseURL with your IP.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://192.168.0.4:3333",
});

export default api;
```

After that, you run

`npm install`

Finish we can start the mobile application with command

`expo start`

### Running on device

You should be download the expo app on your device.

- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=pt_BR)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/expo-client/id982107779)

On page generated by expo command previously, there is a **QRCode**, you can use your device to scan that code and that's all folks.
